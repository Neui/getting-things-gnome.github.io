# Plugins

You can describe and link to your plugin here.

Note: as of 2020, this page is wildly outdated. Someone needs to update
it and/or figure out what to do with this page (some thoughts
[here](https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/issues/200)) so that
it is maintained consistently, along with plugin API documentation
somewhere. See also the [plugin ideas](pre2020/plugin_ideas)
page which might have the same problem in the long term.

use it well, but there is a lot of little moments ;-)
