# Data Model

This wiki tree tries to capture the *data & logic in the data model*
underlying [Getting Things GNOME!](gtg), which is similar & different
in important ways from other software that also use the concepts of
tasks and events.

It contains:

- A brief description of the data model as of
  [/February2010](/Apps/GTG/DataModel/February2010).

- A detailed description of the data model as of
  [/May2010](/Apps/GTG/DataModel/May2010). In the future this may
  become *normative* (ie. a standard).

- Some [/Analysis](/Apps/GTG/DataModel/Analysis) of the data model,
  including proposed changes.

- A spreadsheet with [a side-by-side
  comparison](http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AhRkDXhnjLt8dHM3MmZ0YmJnMm1UM1hySFNlaDBVc1E&hl=en_GB)
  of the GTG data model with other tools.
