# Data Model

This wiki tree tries to capture the *data & logic in the data model*
underlying [Getting Things GNOME!](index), which is similar & different
in important ways from other software that also use the concepts of
tasks and events.

It contains:

- A brief description of the data model as of [February 2010](data_model_feb2010).
- A detailed description of the data model as of [May 2010](data_model_may2010).
  In the future this may become *normative* (ie. a standard).
- Some [Analysis](data_model_analysis) of the data model,
  including proposed changes.
- A spreadsheet with [a side-by-side comparison](http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AhRkDXhnjLt8dHM3MmZ0YmJnMm1UM1hySFNlaDBVc1E&hl=en_GB)
  of the GTG data model with other tools.
