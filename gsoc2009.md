## Abstract

Know a days mobility is very important and it's part of our lives as
well as being organized and knowing what our agenda is.  
One is always forgetting to do something or not prioritizing the tasks
that have to be done. Getting Things Gnome geolocalized tasks will let
people organize or view the tasks that are specific to their current
location in order to be more focused on what needs or what can to be
done there.
