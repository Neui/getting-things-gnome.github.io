# The Idea

## GTG Geolocalized tasks

- Ability to define a tasks location.
- A option to enable location based tasks so that the workview only
  shows the tasks that are possible to do "right now, where you are".
- Ability to see the tasks in a map with a callout.
- The map display of a task also uses it's color (if defined).
- A "map view" that will enable a pane with two columns. On one side
  there will be kind of a workview list of tasks and on the other a
  map with the tasks.
  - When a user zooms (in/out) the list of tasks adapts to the tasks
    shown on the map.

## The GNOME Applet

- List tasks (workview).
- Search tasks.
- Ability to show a map with the tasks (instead of the list).
- When a user clicks on a task GTG opens.
- Ability to create a new tasks from the applet.
