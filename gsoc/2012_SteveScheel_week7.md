# Week 7 Report

This week I hit my goal and got the subtasks completely working along
with all the hyperlinks. You can now add subtasks and they are created
in the full GTG, and clicking on any link opens up whatever it is,
whether a bug report, a url, or a subtask. I got started on saving the
tasks but I'm still figuring out the best way to implement it and when
the task absolutely needs to be saved.
