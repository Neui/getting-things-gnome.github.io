# Getting Things GNOME! Client-Server separation

[This Google Summer of Code project](2010_PaulKishimoto)
involves separating [Getting Things GNOME](..) into a *server*
component handling task logic and storage, and a *client* user
interface. This should improve support for another, web-based UI that is
being developed, create opportunities for other, future UIs, and also
allow increased coordination with other workflow management tools.
