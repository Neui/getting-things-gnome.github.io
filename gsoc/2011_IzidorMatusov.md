# Getting Things GNOME! - rewrite liblarch library for managing directed acyclic graphs

## Abstract

Getting Things GNOME! is a powerful software for managing personal
tasks. It supports many features. Its components must be very flexible
to support all of these features. Unfortunately, GTK
TreeWidget is not and liblarch was created but it needs
to rewrite and separate from GTK as much as possible. I want to rewrite
liblarch that way during the summer.
