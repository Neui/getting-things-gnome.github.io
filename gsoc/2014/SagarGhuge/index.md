# Getting Things GNOME!: Recurring tasks support

*By [Sagar Ghuge](https://wiki.gnome.org/Sagar%20Ghuge)*

## Short Description

GTG is an very used application and focuses on usability and ease of
use. It has an important lack of adding recurring/repeating tasks to
it.([see bug 344432](https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtg/+bug/344432)), ([see
bug 692555](https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtg/+bug/692555)), ([see bug
734622](https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtg/+bug/734622)) The idea is to have
a support for adding repeating tasks in one go. This is a feature that
would complete the transition of many users to GTG and also attract many
users to this project.
