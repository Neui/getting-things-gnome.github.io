# Week 9 Report

This week I was unable to get much done due to the fact that I went out
of town for a few days. However, I did manage to look at what I need to
do to try to get the editor integrated into the rest of GTG, which was
mainly how to get dbus working properly so that the editor and GTG could
properly integrate and communicate with each other.
