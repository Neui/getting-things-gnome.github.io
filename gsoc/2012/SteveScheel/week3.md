# Week 3 Report

For the third week I wanted to rewrite the taskview class, and my goal
fell a little short, but I have made some decent progress on it. One
problem I ran into is that the custom Date class we have is crashing the
program, which means that importing the Task class can't happen because
it depends on the Date class. However, I have the title tag working and
the bold, italics, and underline working mostly (it has some normal
behaviors I haven't quite gotten to yet, such as knowing it's in a bold
tag area, etc.).
