# Week 8 Report

So in the past week I've got saving tasks working right. I had some bugs
to work out but it all seems to be working without a hitch, now.
Unfortunately getting saving tags to work properly was a bit trickier
than I thought it was going to be, because for some reason it did not
like updating tags properly leaving to a tag like @new_tag to give a
task tags @n, @ne @new, etc., so it took longer than I expected. I also
have a button for marking a task as done and deleting tasks done and
working properly, along with the appearance of done tasks now working
properly in the tasks.
