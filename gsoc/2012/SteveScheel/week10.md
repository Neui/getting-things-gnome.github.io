# Week 10 Report

This past week I've been having issues with getting a dbus service
started for the editor so that GTG can communicate that it wants to open
a task, and with poor documentation for dbus on the internet I've been
trying to figure out what is wrong with my service. I hope to resolve
this issue in the next day or two though and move onto the final needed
features for the editor.
