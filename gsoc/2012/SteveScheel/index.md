# Getting Things GNOME!: Reworking the Task Editor

Getting Things GNOME! is a great task scheduling program, but the task
editor could use a few more features, and the code could use some
refactoring, so my project will be to redo the task editor completely,
upgrading it to GTK3, and add some more features such as rich text
editing.
