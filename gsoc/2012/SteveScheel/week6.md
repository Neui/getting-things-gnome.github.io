# Week 6 Report

For the past week I have gotten tags completely working, including
preparing the tags list for the task so that tags should be ready for
saving. I have started working on subtasks and I have a couple different
ideas on how easiest to tackle them, although I am having issues right
now getting the link tag to show up on new subtask titles. I have also
been looking into how the cursor works differently from PyGTK to GTK3 so
that once I have subtasks ready I can implement changing the cursor to
the hand cursor and getting the links to change to show they're being
hovered over.
