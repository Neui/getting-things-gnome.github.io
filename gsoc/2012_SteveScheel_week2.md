# Week 2 Report

I began the week by finishing getting my environment set up and starting
actual coding for the project. This week I got the toolbar done and
setup and began working on our custom GtkTextView.
However, I started running into issues when it came to importing modules
from within the program because Gtk2 and Gtk3 cannot run within the same
thread. I decided to continue coding the editor but loading it separate
from GTG and just testing user input.
