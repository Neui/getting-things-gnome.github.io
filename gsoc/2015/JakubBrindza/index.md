# General re-design of Getting Things GNOME

***Getting things GNOME*** is a great app that many people love to use
daily in order to organise their personal and professional assignments.
However, when it comes to design, GTG is far behind the current GNOME
standards. Therefore I will implement the most modern design features
into the GTG app: I want to add **App menu** and **Header bar** to give
the app clean outlines. Next, I propose designing GTG browser view using
**Stack Switcher** to enable alternation between task view and workview
within the window. Finally, my aim is also to incorporate **Search
entry** and **Gtk Menu Buttons** into the Header bar, since this way
users could focus entirely on the tasks and would not be distracted by
several possible functions the app provides. These would be only a click
away, available immediately from the Header bar.

Moreover, my work will cover also some code reviewing and bug fixing. I
will also re-design the GTG website into a more modern, state-of-the-art
website.
