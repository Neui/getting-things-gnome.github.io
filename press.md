- "Getting Things GNOME 0.4 is here to prove \[…\] that it is here to
  stay for a long time to come, helping you getting your everyday
  stuff done and be more productive."

<https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2020/04/gtg-gtd-app-for-linux>

- "No fads, no flashy timers, and no abstract concepts. Just a rock
  solid focus on having you sort your to dos in a way that gets you to
  do them when they need doing." "GTG isn’t a sticky note pad for idle
  thoughts, but a fully-featured task management conduit. It makes you
  organise and delegate tasks into actionable items, and then makes it
  easy to do those items."

<https://www.linux-magazine.com/Issues/2017/198/Getting-Things-Gnome> (a
pretty good guide)

- "GTD is a proven system for self-organization \[and GTG\] helps you
  implement the GTD system in Linux. The lean and well-arranged
  program supports easy and intuitive use."

<https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2009/07/getting-things-done-with-linux-todo-list-programs/>

- "\[...\] an organizer for the GNOME desktop environment that
  provides a robust feature set and a relatively high level of
  usability" "The GTG user interface provides several convenience
  features that I find particularly advantageous."

<https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/linux-and-open-source/use-getting-things-gnome-to-get-things-done/>

- "In the spirit of GTD, GTG is a simple application with a
  straightforward interface that allows you to spend more time working
  than fiddling with an application that's purpose is to make you work
  more efficiently. Unlike some applications that have cumbersome or
  complicated interfaces, GTG is easy to use and easy to get up and
  running with." "All in all, GTG is a very useful and easy-to-use
  application. I appreciate its simplicity because that means I can
  spend more time actually getting things done, rather than spending
  the time entering in the tasks I need to be doing."

<https://lwn.net/Articles/370454/>

- "GTG is a fairly complete solution and should be sufficient for
  anyone who's looking to implement GTD on a GNOME desktop." "For
  lightweight task management, GTG heads the pack. It's light, fast,
  and provides just enough functionality that users can implement GTD
  or their own brand of task management."

<https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2009/12/to-do-applications-reviewed-updated-with-another-app>

- "\[...\] GTG is much more than just a *to-do list* application."
