# Roadmap

# Maps?! Where we’re going, we don’t need maps!

A foreword by [Jeff](https://fortintam.com/en/):

- This page [used to be](roadmap_old)
  really complicated in its previous incarnation, from 2010 to 2012.

- As part of [GTG](/)'s rebirth in 2020, I am therefore
  rewriting and simplifying this roadmap page to only include
  high-level "orientations"—general goals, not "fix bug/feature
  XYZ"—because feature-list roadmaps in community-driven open-source
  projects are typically pure fabrications and "wishful thinking".

# The organic/dynamic roadmap

The [dynamic milestones](https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/milestones/) are
our "organic" roadmap—or finish lines, pit stops, whatever you want to
call them.

By clicking each milestone, you can see the issues targetted for each of
them. Anything not targetted to a milestone depends on you
[contributing](https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
the fix/improvement, or there is no guarantee that it will happen in a
particular timeframe.

# "Enough with your agile hippie organic nonsense, gimme a traditional roadmap!"

Well, okay. Now that the project is back on track (releasing 0.4 gets us
out of the [dev hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_hell)
the GTG project was stuck in from 2013 to 2019 while it was porting to
Python 3 + GTK 3 + fixing a ton of bugs), this is what we can expect to
be the "general orientations" of the project in the future:

- Fix bugs
- Improve performance
- Incrementally improve the user interface's usability
- Review/improve the test suite (help wanted)
- Help wanted: attract new contributors to work on their favorite new
  features, resurrect and maintain their favorite plugins or sync
  backends
- Get the translations updated
- Get our Flatpak packaging in order ([help
  wanted](https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/issues/233))
- Maybe migrate our main development hub infrastructure "one last
  time" ([help
  wanted](https://github.com/getting-things-gnome/gtg/issues/234))
- Retire in the Carribean and sip piña coladas on the deck of a
  private yacht

# Wait, that's too simple, that's cheating!

![Man showing the finger](https://s2.qwant.com/thumbr/0x0/d/6/c2d7061e734786a9fdd8528a9edc866d63fd36eb42d005db4ac414013dc56c/giphy.gif?u=https://media.giphy.com/media/3o85xyklT2t8VVjxxC/giphy.gif&q=0&b=1&p=0&a=1)

It sure is. The logic behind this minimalistic roadmap is quite simple:

- 99% of roadmaps are bullsh!t, unless there are people working
  full-time on the project. This is also the reason why we only have
  two milestones in our bug tracker: trying to plan more than 1-2
  releases in advance is lying to yourself.

- Focus, focus, focus. Don't try to do everything at once and don't
  ever get trapped into [Development
  Hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_hell) again.
