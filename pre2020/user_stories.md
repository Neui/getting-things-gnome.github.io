# User Stories

What are these? [Read this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story),
then add your own. Remember to keep them concise!

## General

- Albert opens GTG and quickly sees the first thing he should work on
  today.
- Betty opens GTG and immediately begins to organize her outstanding
  work in order to decide what to work on next.
  -   These two stories are in tension.
- Dam receives an email containing a task sent by Samu through GTG.
  Dam's email client (Evolution) can add a task to GTG using
  gtg\_new\_task (that's of course on the Evolution side)
- Dam wants to optionally set a priority for his tasks and then to see
  them sorted by priority
- Dam wants to mark a task as a routinary task

## Backend-related

- Carlos, a student, receives in class a practical homework "Make
  Bench". Being in class, he adds it to his Remember The Milk account
  using his cellphone. When he gets home, Carlos' GTG is dutifully
  displaying the new task, tagged a@ONMYPHONE. To make a bench, Carlos
  need nails and wood. Therefore, he adds two subtasks, "Buy Wood" and
  "Buy Nails," also tagged @ONMYPHONE, since he wants them back there.
  This lets Carlos keep his tasks list tidy inside GTG, while having a
  different "view" of his tasks on his PHONE (because RTM does not
  support subtasks). The view on his phone is messier than the one in
  GTG (which is subtasks-organized), so he prefers looking at his
  tasks on GTG, when he can.
- Donna is already using a web service that does not have task
  descriptions (only titles) or subtasks. She discovers GTG from a
  friend, and decides to give it a try. If she is not allowed to use
  task descriptions or subtasks, Donna's experience of GTG would not
  be great. The browser would be just a list of tasks. Donna should be
  able to understand why, if she wants to sync her tasks with the
  online service she already uses, some of the GTG features will not
  work..
- Ernie has a home-work computer and a netbook. He has his main GTG in
  his work computer, but he is bored when he commutes to the grocery
  store or waits while his kids/dog plays, so he uses that time to
  edit his GTG tasks. That's fine, because he can use a CouchDB
  backend between the two. Ernie is also fond of his new Windows-based
  phone (it was a gift), and being very organized, he'd like to keep
  his tasks there too: the interface is crappy, but is a good fallback
  when he forgets to bring his netbook along.
  - Problem: CouchDB on windows mobile is a myth, but RTM,
    Toodledo... work fine.
- Ernie has lost his netbook (he doesn't worry, since it was
  encrypted). He is stranded with his phone now. He doesn't use RTM,
  since it doesn't support subtasks, but Toodledo suits him fine. He
  has recently developed a Launchpad backend, and he'd like to
  sort/edit his bugs on his phone too. After all, most of his tasks
  are derived from bugs. How can he do it with 1task/1backend?
- Dam, Pietro and Samu work together in a company. They want to import
  in GTG the tickets assigned for everyone on Trac.
