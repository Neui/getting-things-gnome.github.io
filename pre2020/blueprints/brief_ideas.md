- Implement an user-friendly search window (so that the user could
  select which tags to appear, which dates, which words to/not to
  appear, etc - without having to know the text search syntax).
- Have priorities in tasks. I saw that there were some bug reports in
  2010 about this, but I don't see this functionality in the user
  documentation or running gtg. It seems useful to have a priority
  system for tasks, so one could sort the tasks by priority.
- Adding a functionality for users to estimate how much time they will
  spend in a task, so that one could do a search and know how much
  time it 'should' take to finish all tasks. One example of this would
  be searching for tasks due today, and having an estimate of how long
  they will all take. Of course, this would also entail adding an
  'actual time taken' field when users complete a task, so that they
  could have an idea of how good their estimates are.
