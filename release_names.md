Notes:

- The initial commit was on 2008-10-17.

- Most "official" blog posts used to be on GTG's own blog, and were
  lost in a deluge. The links provided above have been recovered with
  Archive.org.

- Additional blog posts are also linked, found on <https://ploum.net/tag/gtg/>

- Version numbers respect some aspects of "semantic versioning", but
  not the whole complicated rulebook. For instance, there is no
  difference between odd and even numbers (no notion of "stable" vs
  "unstable"). From 2008 to 2013 our version numbers were
  "0.major.minor.bugfix" giving indication of how big a release might
  be, but as of 2020 we are getting rid of that nonsense; every
  release stands on equal footing, so from here on, except "paperbag"
  releases, it will be 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, etc.

- Some of the codenames from old versions were references to [Galaxy
  Quest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_Quest), whereas
  codenames for 0.4 and 0.5 are of course references to Evangelion
  (what do you mean, you haven't got time to watch 26 episodes and 6
  movies? OK, then just watch [this fan trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWdAlPDe4g) then.)
