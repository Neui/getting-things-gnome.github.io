# Design Notes

This is a list of notes in no particular order that point out to several
aspects that should be taken into account for GTG's redesign.

## Choosing/Planning what to do

People seems to be more enclined to eprform work when they can focus on
a limited number of tasks. One way to obtain this is to provide help in
identifying relevant tasks and helping people to plan future work (e.g.:
tomorrow work) as a short list of tasks.

See this thread for reference:

And this extract in particular:

- "(...) I figured out that I am likely to do something when I see
  only few tasks. If I can choose from 5 tasks (and 3 could not be
  done now at this place), I choose one and do it. If I have many
  tasks and there still only 2 relevant tasks, I end up
  procrastinating. (choice paradox). I would like to see as less tasks
  as possible for the work day and in the evening do micro planning
  for tomorrow (choose a subset of available tasks so in the morning I
  start working on it without planning phase)."
